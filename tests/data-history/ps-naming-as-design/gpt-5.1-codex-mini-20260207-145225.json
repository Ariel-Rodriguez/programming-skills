The `And` signals that the routine is doing more than one thing; a well-named function should describe a single action (e.g., `saveUser` or `logActivity`) so the design and intent are obvious without reading the body.\n- Because the name combines persistence and logging, it doesn\u2019t encode the business intent or constraints\u2014readers must ask \u201cwhy are these things tied together?\u201d instead of seeing a clear story. Good names should reveal intent (purpose and why) rather than implementation details or sequences, and `saveUserAndLogActivity` leaves the relationship and order ambiguous."

Neither introduces extra depth beyond the shared critique, so their adherence and maintainability are effectively tied, leaving them equally preferable."
