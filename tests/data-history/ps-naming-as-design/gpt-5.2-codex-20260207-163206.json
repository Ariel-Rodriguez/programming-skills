        "response_full": "Because it encodes two responsibilities in one name, which signals a leaky abstraction. \u201cNaming as Design\u201d pushes you to name things for a single, cohesive behavior. `saveUserAndLogActivity` exposes internal steps and implies the function does two jobs (persistence + logging), so the name reveals a design smell rather than a clear capability. A better design is either a higher-level name that represents one intent (e.g., `registerUser`) or split into two functions and name each for its single responsibility."

I\u2019ll answer directly.\n\n`saveUserAndLogActivity` violates the Naming as Design principle because the name exposes two distinct responsibilities (`saveUser` and `logActivity`). The \u201cAnd\u201d signals mixed concerns, which means the design is likely conflating persistence and auditing. A good name should reveal a single purpose, and if both actions are required, they should be separate, clearly named operations or a higher-level domain action that captures the *why* (e.g., `registerUser` if logging is part of registration invariants)."
